**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: May 13, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've started with one of my unfinished React app. It's an app like theMovieDB. I had started this app a few months ago but didn't finished it. I'm working on the cards and it's not finised yet.

**Thoughts** I've started learning React at the beginning of 2019 but didn't get much opportunity to work with it. After doing a full-time dev job, I always struggle with time and consistency. That's why my skills on React didn't grow much. Hope I could grow my React skillset upto Production level & learn a few new things through this challenge

### Day 2: May 14, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Basic design has completed of the cards. Also make it a responsive carousel. Make it funcional with dynamic content (dummy).

**Thoughts**: I'm not using any CSS library. Trying to all features with custom code. Also trying to avoid npm packages as much as I can. If I wanted I could add react-multi-carousel package for the carousel I have used in the cards.

### Day 3: May 15, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Modify the funcionality of the slider. Use react hook to the slider arrow functionality. Used useRef hook for this functionality. It's very usefull when you're trying to do DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts**: Practice is the key. Maybe I've completed 10+ react courses on different platform but I didn't learn this much. So you should practice what you learn.

### Day 4: May 16, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Installed @reach/router and configured the route of the app. Also work on the homePage. It's not completed yet.

**Thoughts**: Reach router and React router are similar but it's easier to learn and implement. Highly recommended for beginners.

### Day 6: May 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on details page. Design isn't completed yet. 

**Thoughts**: I know I'm going slow. I'm giving only an hour or little much. I'll try to increase the time in upcoming days.
