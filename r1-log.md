## Log

### R1D1

**Today's Progress**: I've started with one of my unfinished React app. It's an app like theMovieDB. I had started this app a few months ago but didn't finished it. I'm working on the cards and it's not finised yet.

**Thoughts** I've started learning React at the beginning of 2019 but didn't get much opportunity to work with it. After doing a full-time dev job, I always struggle with time and consistency. That's why my skills on React didn't grow much. Hope I could grow my React skillset upto Production level & learn a few new things through this challenge
